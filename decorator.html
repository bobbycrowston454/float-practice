      <h2>Transforming your house into a liveable abode</h2>
      <p>
        Below is the project we are most proud of...
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column before">
      <img src="img/before.jpg" alt="run down room" />
      <p>
        Here is the house left rundown for over 50 years. Our clients hired us to fix up the house and make it awesome since the house price was so cheap.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="column during">
      <img class ="pad" src="img/during.jpg" alt="construction site" />
      <p>
        Here we ripped down most of the rooms and started the constructions process.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column after">
      <img class="pad" src="img/after.jpg" alt="mansion" />
      <p>
        Here is our end product... I think we did a pretty good job.
